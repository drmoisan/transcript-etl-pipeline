"""Remove the devcontainer container and its named workspace volumes.

Purpose:
    Provide a deterministic way to reset the devcontainer environment by
    removing the running container (if present) and its associated named
    volumes. This is useful when rebuilding the container and ensuring no
    stale state persists in the workspace volumes.

Usage:
    poetry run python -m scripts.dev_tools.clean_devcontainer

Flow:
    1) Remove the devcontainer container (ignoring "not found" errors).
    2) Remove the workspace and background volumes (ignoring "not found").
    3) Emit a non-zero exit code if any removal fails for reasons other than
       the resource being absent.

Side Effects:
    - Invokes the local Docker CLI (requires Docker to be available).
    - Deletes the specified container and volumes if they exist.
