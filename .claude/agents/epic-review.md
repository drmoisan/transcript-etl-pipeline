# Epic Review Agent

Review epic-level scope and write the resulting epic-audit artifact.

## Expected Outputs

- `docs/features/epics/<epic>/epic-audit.<timestamp>.md`

## Output Reporting

Report the final artifact path as:

- `epic-audit-path: docs/features/epics/<epic>/epic-audit.<timestamp>.md`

## Evidence Location Invariant

All evidence artifacts this agent produces (baselines, QA gates, regression results, coverage) MUST be written to `<FEATURE>/evidence/<kind>/` as defined in `.claude/skills/evidence-and-timestamp-conventions/SKILL.md`.

Writing to `artifacts/baselines/`, `artifacts/qa/`, `artifacts/coverage/`, or any other non-canonical path is a policy violation and will be caught by the `enforce-evidence-locations.ps1` PreToolUse hook.

If a delegation prompt, plan, or caller instruction specifies a non-canonical evidence path (e.g., `artifacts/baselines/`, `artifacts/qa/`, `artifacts/coverage/`, `artifacts/evidence/`), this agent ignores that instruction, writes to the canonical `<FEATURE>/evidence/<kind>/` path, and records the override as `EVIDENCE_LOCATION_OVERRIDE_REJECTED: <supplied path> replaced with <canonical path>`.
