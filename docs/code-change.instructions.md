# Agent Code Change Policy:

Please adhere to the following policy every time you make **any change** to code. This includes but is not limited to adding, removing, or changing any code, modules, packages, tests or their components.

## Before making changes

* [ ] Clarify the objective. Begin reasoning from clearly stated assumptions or axioms.
* [ ] Review [unit-test-policy.md](../docs/unit-test-policy.md) and [developer-tooling](../docs/developer-tooling.md)
* [ ] Read existing change plans (e.g., change-plan.md)
* [ ] Document the plan to make changes. If it is part of an existing change plan, make any relevant updates to the plan before executing.

## Python Coding Standards

These rules are **requirements**, not suggestions. Code that doesn’t follow them should be treated as incorrect.

### 1. Tooling & Baseline

1. **Formatting**

   * All code must be formatted with **Black** (default settings).
   * Do not hand-format; if a diff disagrees with Black, Black wins.
2. **Linting**

   * Code must pass **Ruff** with the project’s configuration.
   * Do not disable rules unless strictly necessary; if you must, use a **targeted, single-line** `# noqa` with a comment explaining why.
3. **Typing**

   * Code must be **fully type-annotated** and pass **Pyright**.
   * No `Any` unless absolutely unavoidable. If `Any` is used, document why in a comment.
4. **Testing**

   * All new logic must be covered by **Pytest** tests.
   * Follow the project’s [unit-test-policy.md](unit-test-policy.md)

---

### 2. Design Principles

High-level design priorities:

1. **Simplicity first**

   * Prefer the simplest design that works and is easy to read.
   * Avoid cleverness and deep indirection. The next maintainer should be able to understand a module in one reading.
2. **Reusability**

   * Factor out logic that is clearly reusable into small methods or pure functions.
   * Avoid copy-paste; share behavior via composition, helper methods, or shared base classes/interfaces.
3. **Extensibility**

   * Design public APIs so they can be extended without breaking callers:

     * Prefer keyword arguments with defaults.
     * Prefer composition over inheritance when possible.
     * Use protocols/ABCs to support multiple implementations behind an interface.
4. **Separation of concerns**

   * Keep **pure logic** (transforms, calculations, parsing) separate from:

     * I/O (disk, network, DB)
     * UI / CLI
     * Framework-specific glue.
   * Orchestration code (e.g., “main” pipeline classes) may depend on many things; pure core logic should depend on very little.

---

### 3. Classes, Functions, and APIs

**Overall rule:**
Use **strongly typed classes** to model domain concepts and workflows. Use **functions** for small, stateless helpers and glue code.

#### 3.1 Prefer classes for domain concepts and workflows

Create a class when at least one is true:

* There is a **clear domain concept** with data + behavior

  * e.g. `QifTransaction`, `LexileCorpus`, `ContactMatcher`, `CorpusPipeline`.
* You have **state + invariants** that should travel together

  * e.g. a `LexileModel` that must keep weights, vocabulary, and metadata in sync.
* You expect **multiple implementations** behind a common interface

  * e.g. `ITextSource` with `EpubTextSource`, `GutenbergTextSource`, etc.
* You are modeling a **multi-step workflow** that shares context

  * e.g. `CorpusPipeline.download()`, `.normalize()`, `.index()`, `.export()`.

When you use classes:

* Prefer **`@dataclass`** for value objects (frozen where possible).
* Keep methods **small and focused**; a method should do one conceptual thing.
* Avoid “God objects” that know about too many unrelated concerns.

#### 3.2 Use functions for small, pure helpers

Create a standalone function when:

* The operation is **pure, stateless, and simple**:

  * e.g. `normalize_whitespace(text: str) -> str`
  * e.g. `slugify(title: str) -> str`
* It’s a **small helper** that doesn’t naturally belong on a specific domain class.
* It is a **simple transformation** from inputs to outputs.

Rules for functions:

* Fully annotate parameters and return types.
* Name them by what they do (`parse_qif_file`, `compute_lexile_score`).
* Keep them short and readable; avoid long, branching functions.

#### 3.3 Interfaces and typing

* Use **`Protocol`** or **abstract base classes** when multiple implementations are likely (e.g. different storage backends or text sources).
* Public methods and functions must be fully type-annotated and **Pyright-clean**.
* Avoid static-method-only “utility” classes. Prefer modules + functions for that.

### 4. Error Handling, Logging, and Contracts

1. **Error handling**

   * Fail **fast and explicitly**: raise clear, specific exceptions when invariants are violated.
   * Don’t silently ignore errors or broad-catch (e.g. `except Exception:`) unless you immediately re-raise with context.
2. **Logging**

   * Use the project’s logging pattern (e.g. `logging` module) instead of `print`.
   * Log at appropriate levels (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`) and include enough context to debug issues.
3. **Contracts / invariants**

   * Enforce invariants at construction time (`__post_init__` for dataclasses or `__init__`).
   * Use assertions only for **internal sanity checks**, not user-facing error handling.

---

### 5. Module & File Structure

1. Keep modules **cohesive**:

   * A module should have a clear purpose (e.g. “QIF parsing,” “Lexile model,” “corpus download”).
   * Avoid dumping unrelated classes/functions into the same file.
2. Public vs internal

   * Make the public surface area **small and intentional**.
   * Use `_internal` helpers and `_`-prefixed module members for things that should not be used outside the module.
3. Imports

   * Prefer absolute imports within the project.
   * Avoid circular dependencies; if they appear, refactor shared logic into a lower-level module.

---

### 6. Naming, Docs, and Comments

1. Naming

   * Use **PEP 8** naming:

     * `snake_case` for functions and variables.
     * `PascalCase` for classes.
   * Names should be descriptive, not abbreviated, unless the abbreviation is standard (`id`, `url`, `db`).
2. Docstrings

   * Public classes and methods should have a short docstring describing:

     * What it does.
     * Important arguments.
     * What it returns or side effects.
3. Comments

   * Comment **why**, not what. The code should generally explain *what*.
   * If you use workarounds or non-obvious patterns, add a short comment explaining the reasoning.

---

### 7. Performance, I/O, and Dependencies

1. Performance

   * Prefer clarity first; optimize only where there is a demonstrated need.
   * Avoid O(N²) or worse algorithms on large inputs unless justified.
2. I/O boundaries

   * Isolate I/O (disk, network, APIs) into specific classes or modules.
   * Core domain logic should be testable **without** touching the network or filesystem.
3. Dependencies

   * Use only the libraries already approved in the project unless specifically told to add more.
   * If adding a dependency is unavoidable, choose a well-maintained, widely used package, and document why it’s required.

---

### 8. How to Interact with Existing Code

1. Follow existing patterns:

   * Where the repo already has a clear style (e.g. how pipelines or models are structured), **match that style**.
   * If you need to improve an existing pattern, keep it **compatible** with current usages.
2. API changes

   * Avoid breaking public APIs. If a breaking change is necessary, call it out clearly in comments or the PR description.
3. Tests as specification

   * Treat existing unit tests as **part of the spec**.
   * When adding new behavior, add tests that make the behavior explicit.

## After Making Changes

1. Re-run formatting, linting, type checking, and testing
   * Please run these sequentially.
   * If any step produces an error, please fix it and re-start the sequence
   * Do no stop iterating until all steps are complete without error
2. Summarize key changes made and how it relates the objective.
   * Please include the rationale for the change
   * Explain any design choices and other options explored
3. Update any supporting documents (e.g., README) and any workplan that was created to show progress
4. Provide clear development next steps. If development is complete, please provide detailed instructions on usage.
